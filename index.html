      I've always been told that a good game can be described in many forms, so here is a video, a haiku, and a comparison to existing products to give you a good feel for what we've got in store for you!
    </p>
    <p>
      find the vidoe <br>
      you will not expect it there <br>
      inside your dreams <br>
    </p>
    <p>
      The sound you're hearing is the sound that is made whenever you walk off the beaten path in the upcoming game: "try to concentrate with all this annoying stuff going on". If it's annoying, just imagine trying to multitask with a wide variety of similar yet non-identical sounds taking up your attention. Feel free to turn it off for now though!
